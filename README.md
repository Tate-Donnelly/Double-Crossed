# Double-Crossed
Double Crossed a stealth game where you play as a double agent in a three-letter government agency. As this agent, you sneak through a classified government facility to gather intel and report back to your true occupational agency. Unlike most stealth games, Double-Crossed isn't just an action game that optionally features stealth. It's mandatory, as you have an extremely limited number of bullets that aren't nearly enough for the number of guards patrolling the facility. The only way you would be able to make it through is by avoiding them entirely- or knocking them out from behind, which costs no ammo. The game is designed to be able to played without firing a single bullet!
